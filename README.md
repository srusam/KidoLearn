# KidoLearn - An Educational Gaming Website for Kids
Every parent wants their child to learn things at a faster rate. It is possible only when the child actually enjoys the process of learning. However deep understanding starts when the child is aware of its environment. We have also seen parents trying to teach their children about the objects that are around them. Unfortunately, seldom does the young child remember. Thatâ€™s what the point is. In this competitive world, rote learning will take a person nowhere. But, picture visualization can! <br><br>
Young children explore and learn with mobile devices in ways that are natural to them (touch, repeat, trial and error). The development of early childhood education applications has also become a trend, leading to more and more preschool children engaging in Technology. Preschoolers need to understand the difference between animate and inanimate objects. A one-year-old child should recognize the names of simple and common objects. By 2 years, the child should know the names of body parts and objects. That's why identification plays a vital role in early brain development. Studies show that learning a language increases the volume and density of gray matter, the volume of white matter, and brain connectivity. It's always easier to learn a language for a child than for an adult. But what if one wants identification and learning a new language together? <br><br>
So, it would be great if a child could have object identification and language learning in one place and this is what KidoLearn does.
